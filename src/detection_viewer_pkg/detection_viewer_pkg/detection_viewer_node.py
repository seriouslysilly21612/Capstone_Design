"""Desktop-side bbox overlay viewer for the KV260 perception pipeline.

Runs on the DESKTOP, not the board. Subscribes to the board's compressed color
stream and /detections, draws the boxes, and shows the result. The board only
compresses; all drawing happens here.

Two render modes — the video and the boxes arrive at DIFFERENT rates (color
30 fps, detections ~15 Hz), and you cannot have both smooth video and
frame-exact boxes, because a frame's own boxes only exist ~107 ms after it was
captured:

  smooth (default)  render every color frame -> 30 fps, near-live video, with
                    the newest boxes available. Boxes therefore lag the picture
                    by ~107 ms (invisible on a static pick scene; on a fast
                    moving object the box trails it).
  --sync            render only frames whose EXACT detection arrived -> 15 fps,
                    ~107 ms behind live, boxes pixel-exact on their own frame.
                    This is the mode that verified bbox<->frame alignment
                    (2026-07-16); keep using it for that check.

Either way the board sends the same 30 fps JPEG stream and pays the same cost —
smooth mode simply stops throwing half the decoded frames away.

Why not draw on the board: the detector's own overlay path costs ~44 ms/frame on
top of a 37.6 ms detect, which busts the 66.6 ms budget for 15 Hz. Drawing here
costs the board nothing.

Wire contract (verified against the board 2026-07-16, see
docs/vision/desktop_viewer_plan.md):
  - Detection bbox coords are pixels in the ORIGINAL color frame, center+size.
    The worker already undoes the 416x416 letterbox, so do NOT rescale here.
  - DetectionArray.header is a byte copy of the source Image header, so an
    exact (sec, nanosec) join is valid.
  - /detections is RELIABLE; the compressed image inherits SYSTEM_DEFAULT
    (= RELIABLE), and a BEST_EFFORT subscriber is compatible with it.
