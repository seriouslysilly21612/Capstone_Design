"""nearest_by_stamp: pick the depth frame closest to the color capture instant.

Guards the 2026-08-04 change from 'newest depth' to 'nearest depth' — the whole
point is that the newest frame is the WRONG one, so a regression that quietly
reverts to buf[-1] must fail here. Pure function, no ROS needed:
    python3 -m pytest src/target_3d_pkg/test/test_depth_pick.py
